# Vesta

Our mission: check every property in the world for accessibility. You can help us. 

A Zinc project by Sara, Alexandra, Zan, and Anthony.

## About

1.8 million disabled people in the UK struggle to find accessible housing. A very small percentage of houses in the UK are listed as accessible. Vesta is here to help.

The Vesta app enables anyone with a smartphone to easily survey the accessibility of their property.
